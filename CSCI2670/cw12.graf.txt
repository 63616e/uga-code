__ Phrase structure grammars

> A **{phrase structure grammar} (PSG) is a variation of a context-free grammar that uses a lexicon instead of an alphabet.  A **{lexicon} is a set of words (each consisting of one or more lowercase letters).

> The lexicon is defined in a PSG by lexical rules.  A **{lexical rule} is a grammar rule that has a single lexical word on the right hand side of the rule.

> By convention, the following variable names are often used in PSGs:
:fig table
{
Variable name#Meaning
S#Sentence
NP#Noun phrase
VP#Verb phrase
D#Determiner (article)
N#Noun
V#Verb
}
[i] The variable names above are conventional and have no special meaning in \graf.

__ Exercises
> Consider the following PSG:
:+ psg G1
{
S->NP VP
NP->D N
VP->V NP
D->the
N->cat|dog
V->chases
}

1. List all sentences belonging to the language recognized by G1.

**{the cat chases the dog}
**{the dog chases the cat}
**{the cat chases the cat}
**{the dog chases the dog}

2. Modify your grammar by adding the following words to your lexicon: \[dogs, cats, chase]

:+ psg psg2
{
S->NP VP
NP->D N
VP->V NP
D->the
N->cat|dog|dogs|cats
V->chases|chase
}

3. Give two new sentences accepted by your grammar from #2 that are also grammatical according to the English language,

**{the dogs chase the cats}
**{the cats chase the dogs}

:sim psg2 the dogs chase the cats
:sim psg2 the cats chase the dogs

4. The sentence \[the dogs chases the cat] is not considered grammatical according to English but is accepted by the grammar from #2.  List two other sentences that are accepted by the grammar from #2 but are not considered grammatical in English.

**{the cats chases the cat}
**{the dogs chases the cats}

:sim psg2 the cats chases the cat
:sim psg2 the dogs chases the cats

5. Explain why your new grammar allow your sentences from #4 instead of deeming them to be ungrammatical.

**{Because the new grammar cannot understand whether the noun is a singular noun or a plural one, there's no verb noun agreement.}

6. Add new phrase rules to your grammar to address your discovery in #5.  Your new grammar should accept sentences like \[the dog chases the cat] while rejecting sentences like \[the dogs chases the cat].

:+ psg psg3
{
S->NP VP
NP->D PN|SN
VP->SV|PV NP
D->the
SN->cat|dog
PN->cats|dogs
SV->chases
PV->chase
}

:sim psg3 the dogs chase the cats
:sim psg3 the cats chase the cats
*{These should be false}
:sim psg3 the cat chase the dog
:sim psg3 the cats chases the dogs
