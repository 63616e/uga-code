__> CSCI 2670, Fall 2021 (morning)


Group: CJ, Tom

___ Instructions
|> Create a Grafstate document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
|> You may work in small groups.  List in your document *{all} of the students in your group.

___ Exercises
1. Give a recursive definition to define the length of a string over an alphabet \S.


**{Base case is:}
**{\epsilon is an element of Sigma.}

**{Recursive step:}

**{Let a be an element of \S.  ( a \in \S) . \S being the character for is the alphabet.}
**{Let c be in \S as well . Then a*c would be in \S .}


2. Consider the following DFA:

:+ dfa M
{
Q={q1,q2,q3,q4}
S={a,b}
q0=q1
d(q1,a)=q3
d(q1,b)=q4
d(q2,a)=q1
d(q2,b)=q2
d(q3,a)=q3
d(q3,b)=q4
d(q4,a)=q1
d(q4,b)=q2
F={q2,q4}
















}

Write the \graf code for a DFA that recognizes the complement of L(M).

:+ dfa dfa1
{
Q={q1,q2,q3,q4}
S={a,b}
q0=q1
d(q1,a)=q3
d(q1,b)=q4
d(q2,a)=q1
d(q2,b)=q2
d(q3,a)=q3
d(q3,b)=q4
d(q4,a)=q1
d(q4,b)=q2
F={q1,q3}










}

3. Give three examples of strings that are accepted by M and rejected by your machine.
**{(ab, abb, abbb)}
3. Give three examples of strings that are rejected by M and accepted by your machine.
**{ (\epsilon, a,aa)}
4. Explain why your machine works.

**{(The newly constructed complement M' is the complement language of the initial DFA, M. They , however, use the same alphabet. The answers rejected by the initial definition of dfa M are accepted the by the complement of M, M'.)}
