__ Exercises

**{1. Prove that a Turing machine with a doubly-infinite tape is not more powerful that a Turing machine with a usual tape.}

We can model through description as well, let P_{left} be the left portion of the input and let P_{right} be the right portion (blank spaces) including the string.

TM with a doubly-infinite tape can be simulated a TM with two tapes marking the beginning of the input string and ignoring P_{left}.

A two tape TM can also simulate a TM with a doubly-infinite tape by using one tape for P_{left} and the other (second tape) for P_{right} but in reverse.

**{2. Prove that A_{TM} \mred ~{EQ_{TM}}.}

EQTM = { | M1,M2 are two TMs such that L(M1)=L(M2)}
or EQTM checks whether two languages are equivalent.

ATM = all inputs are accepted.
EQTM=the inputs are equal.

we define our reducibility as function:
m1 = accept all inputs
m2 = input x
1. ignore input, run M on w
2. If M accepts w, accept
3. reject

L(M1) = \0
if M accepts w, then L(M2) = \S*
if M reject w, then L(M2) = \0

thus m1,w \in ATM and f(m,w) =  which are also \in ~{EQTM}.

Therefore we can say that ATM is mapping reducible to ~{EQTM}.

**{3. Argue that EQ_{TM} is not Turing recognizable and that ~{EQ_{TM}} is not Turing recognizable.}

Since ~{A_{TM}} \mred EQ_{TM} is the same thing as A_{TM} \mred ~{EQ_{TM}}.

We can argue that both EQTM and ~{EQTM} are **{NOT} Turing recognizable.
Mapping reducibility should hold value as inverse as well, which means A_{TM} \mred ~{EQ_{TM}} is also possible for ~{A_{TM}} \mred EQ_{TM}.

We can test the recognizablity by doing another version of our prove above,  ~{A_{TM}} \mred ~{EQ_{TM}} which would automatically be not turing recognizable given ~{A_{TM}} is not recognizable. If we were to do the complement of each, or A_{TM} mred EQ_{TM}, it would still be not turing recognizable. This would mean that EQ_{TM} is not co-recognizable, which means it's not **{co-recognizable} in either of the cases.
