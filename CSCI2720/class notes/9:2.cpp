viewing a library from 3 levels 

4 basic kinds of ADT operations 

constructor: let's say you have a list adp and you're creating an object from it so you'd be creating an instance of that ADT 
transformer: change the state of one or more data values (set method )
observer: access data without changing it (get method )
iterator: go through each element sequential and do some processing with it 

composite data type: store a collection of data values under one name and you're able to access it [string, array, struct]

read about struct 

A: (1.1)^n
B: 2000n^2
B will be faster since A is exponential. 

names of orders of magnitude: (arrange them in order of growth and speed)

complexity of an algorithm

nested loops o^2 

slide 54, the range of the array

S= n(n-1)/2

/*
analysis of algorithm

you look at what the primitive operations are, pseudocode and you identify what primitive operations are 

asymptotic notation: same as the big O notation
