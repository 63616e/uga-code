at least one problem from graph 


edge is a vertex pair , edge from (1,2) is the same as (2,1)
when two vertices are related, you draw an edge

multigraph -> multiple edges between two vertices

 how many edges are there in a complete directed graph?
 
 each vertex = v-1 edges
 in a directed graph v*(v-1)
 in an undirected graph it'd be v*(v-1) / 2

 weighted graph -> a graph in which the each edge caries a value 


adjacency matrix -> 2d array between vertices (storage complexity v^2), (v+v^2) cost of the adjacency matrix (v for vertices, v^2 for edges)
linkedlist -> no need for those 0s 
0 or infinite -> 0 for missing edges. 


if array doesn't work, use linked list


depth-first search -> DFS
