// 10 days for the first assignment, 7 days in the next ones. 

//  for the hw, class concept (2 classes), build classes like we've done in class (header .h and implementation at cpp)
// cli arguments, you'll read the file names from the command line arguments fileio
// makefile


// thursday september 9th , quiz 1 will be 10_09, 10_03 and 10_02 ( reading assignment chapter 2 data stuff [CH_2 ])

/* 
ADT
Domain of the data
Operations that you can perform on the data

you don't talk about the implementation, we only care about the domain and the operation that we can perform on. the way you implement this is called Data Structures. 


u element of S -> search 
S = S union e -> insert
S = S - e -> delete



e.g. 
ADT: List called S 

 1. Domain of the data (0-100 grades )
 2. Operations that you can perform on the data (compute max, compute min, compute average) 

Analysis of algorithm:

Time complexity, space complexity

we care about the growth of the data
