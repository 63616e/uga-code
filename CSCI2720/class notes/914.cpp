/*


slide 9 
unsorted array based list:
3,7,5..
within this example, 3 is not an integer, it's an object of ItemType. within this case, your implementation is not based on a data type. 


(length == max_item-1) -> isFull()
(length == 0) -> isEmpty() 
length is zero bc it's not been initialized yet
